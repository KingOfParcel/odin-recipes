    <h2>Cooking steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><h4><strong>step 1</strong></h4>
                    <p>Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl,
                    then stir in the yeast and salt.
                Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and 
                bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft,
                fairly wet dough. 
                Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. 
                Cover with a tea towel and set aside. 
                You can leave the dough to rise if you like,
                but it’s not essential for a thin crust.</p>    
            </li>
            <li><h4><strong>step 2</strong></h4>
                <p>Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, 
                    then season to taste. 
                    Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h4><strong>step 3</strong></h4>
                <p>Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, 
                    then split into two balls. 
                    On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across,
                    using a rolling pin. 
                    The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven.
                    Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h4><strong>step 3</strong></h4>
                <p>Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. 
                    Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. 
                    Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. 
                    Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. 
                    Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. 
                    Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. 
                    Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using.
                    Repeat step for remaining pizza.</p>
